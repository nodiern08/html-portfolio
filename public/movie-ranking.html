<h1>The Best Movies Acording to Nodier</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Jurrasic Park</h3>

<p>I kid you not; I've watched this movie more than 30 times.</p>

<p>
    I love dinosaurs, and as a child, I'd rewatch this movie all the time.<br>
    My sisters still remind me often how I would put on the movie every night before bed<br>
    and run out of my room frightened during this particular "scary" scene.
</P>

<p>This movie holds a special place in my heart and I'll love it forever.</p>

<h3>2. Interstellar</h3>

<p>Okay, so I love anything related to aliens and outer space.</p>
    
<p>
    I find the idea of "Are we alone?" fascinating, and the sheer size of our universe is mind-boggling.<br> 
    Albeit there are no aliens in this movie, that does not deter me from believing this movie is a masterpiece.<br> 
    Interstellar has impressive visuals, acting, and a crazy representation of how the universe could behave.<br> 
    From drama, love, and space-warping ideas, this movie has it all.
</p>

<h3>3. Signs</h3>

<p>Last but not least, Signs.</p>

<p>
    Are we alone? I'd like to believe we are not.<br>
    What are the chances that we are the only living beings in our universe?<br>
    Who knows, but there's a good chance there's life out there.</p>

<p>Isn't that exciting?</p>

<p>
    To some, it may be, like myself. But what if these extraterrestrials are not the happy little grays we imagined?<br>    
    What if they were hostile? And how would the world react to an invasion?
</p>

<p>
    Signs showcase the horror in the idea of being in the presence of a hostile being not from this world.<br>
    In this movie, you will watch a family live out that horror fantasy and do whatever it takes to keep themselves safe.
</p> 

<p>
    I have Signs on my 3rd spot because of the suspenseful upcoming of what a hostile alien invasion could look like,<br>
    without the dramatic catastrophe of spaceships flying everywhere destroying everything in sight.
</p>

<p>Instead, it's a slow-paced thriller that builds up right in the comfort of your very own home.</p>
